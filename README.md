Responsive flip menu
====================

Another responsive design proof of concept navigation pattern *(following on from [this one](http://neilcarpenter.com/demos/stack-menu/))*. See experiment write up [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/labs/flip-menu). Uses jQuery but not dependent. Effect is achieved with CSS transitions and 3D transforms so will not work in browsers that don't support these features.

Fonts provided by [Typekit](http://typekit.com) and background pattern by [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com).
